# Data-Efficient Model Compression
This repo is the Pytorch implementation of Data-Efficient Model Compression. 

# Background

Many attempts have been done to extend the great success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieved on high-end GPU servers to portable devices such as smart phones. Providing compression and acceleration service of deep learning models on the cloud is therefore of significance and is attractive for end users. However, existing network compression and acceleration approaches usually fine-tuning the svelte model by requesting the entire original training data (e.g. ImageNet), which could be more cumbersome than the network itself and cannot be easily uploaded to the cloud. Therefore, data-efficient neural network compression becomes a hopspot.
